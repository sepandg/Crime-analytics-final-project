# Crime Analytics Course:
For this course I studied the data set provided by New York City police department which includes data such as when a crime happened, what type of crime was committed and where this incident took place. For this project I studied burglaries and used published journals findings regarding burglaries as the basis of my analysis and reformed data mining and analysis by applying my findings from the journals into the dataset. 

The main analysis of my paper was to feature engineer a variable called ‘Near Repeat’. This variable shows that the crime that was reported was considered a near repeat offense if another reported incident for burglary, for the same property type (residential apartment, construction site etc.) was reported and the crime happened within a two week interval from the current observation and the crime happened within 600 feet of original observation, calculated by the Manhattan distance between locations. For example, if there are two locations A and B and they are within 600 feet from each other. Location A is the origin, if location A is burglarized and within two weeks location B is also burglarized, a value of 1 would be assign to Location A. Later when evaluating Location B , since this location was burglarized within two weeks of a previous burglary it would also be assigned the value of 1. If the observation does not meet both criteria above it would be assigned a value of 0. For This method if the same location is burglarized within the time frame it is still counted as a near repeat burglary
