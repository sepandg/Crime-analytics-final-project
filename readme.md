# Crime Analytics Course:
For this course I studied the data set provided by New York City police department which includes data such as when a crime happened, what type of crime was committed and where this incident took place. For this project I studied burglaries and used published journals findings regarding burglaries as the basis of my analysis and reformed data mining and analysis by applying my findings from the journals into the dataset.
